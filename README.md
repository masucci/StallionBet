<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

In this project, I've displayed all the items in a TableView. I also added some features like, Dark mode, different labels to improve the UX/UI.

The logo was created with illustrator.

I was careful to write a clean code, refactoring and do some improvements after the first writing. :smile:
