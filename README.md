<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This is app is projected to works with iPhone with a native environment. I've used XCode as IDE. 
In the project, all the items are displayed in a TableView. The data are downloaded from a remote JSON. I've used the same structure of your JSON adding 10 races. I've also modifed some of them. Before the access you should authenticate yourself with the FaceID/TouchID. I used different Cell to help the user to understand the loading process. In the first view after the authentication, you can see displayed all the races. CLicking on a race you go to the respective page where you can find. information about the race in the header and all the odds displayed in a TableView. You can also order the odds by: Form, Odd, Cloth Number (these three value are displayed as value in the cells.) Finally clicking the odd I use Safari Services to open SkyBet webpage.

I also added some features like, Dark mode, little design to improve the UX/UI.

The logo was created with illustrator.

I was careful to write a clean code, refactoring and do some improvements after the first writing. :smile:
